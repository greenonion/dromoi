# AGENTS

## Project
- We are building a website for people to explore scales of Greek folk music.

## Tech Stack
- Keep it boring: plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use Ruby for the local server and tooling.

## Workflow
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit).
